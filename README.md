<p align="center">Gpoint was created in order to use full set of functions of mobile modules installed in OpenWRT router.
Manufacturers of GSM/3G/LTE modems often lay down GNSS function, so why not use it?
It doesn't matter if you use a router in transport or it is installed in your terminal, you can always find out its location!</p>

## Features

- Support: GPS, GLONASS (works with "NMEA 0183" standard protocol)
- [GPSD](https://gpsd.io) is supported for parsing NMEA data from a modem or your gps device
- GeoHash (reduces drift of GPS\GLONASS coordinate readings in parking)
- [Kalman filter](https://github.com/lacker/ikalman) (Implementation of Kalman filter for geo (gps) tracks.
  This is a Lua port of original C code)
- Yandex Locator [API](https://yandex.ru/dev/locator/) (Determines location by nearest Wi-Fi access points)
- Simple [GeoFence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence) a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic area
- Server side (sends GNSS data to a remote server)
- Support [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) maps in UI, and much more!

- [Wialon IPS](https://gurtam.com/ru/gps-hardware/soft/wialon-ips)

## How to add an unsupported device

- Most importantly, your device should be able to constantly send NMEA data to any of the available ports.

  EXAMPLE: `/dev/ttyUSB*`

- In the model file, you must add the vid, pid, and name of your device.

  MODEL PATH: [/usr/lib/lua/luci/model/cbi/gpoint/gpoint.lua](luasrc/model/cbi/gpoint/gpoint.lua)

  ADD DEVICE:

  ```lua
  local modems = {
      ["Quectel"] = {
          ["2c7c:0306"] = "EP06",
          ...
      },
      ["MY_DEVICE_VENDOR_NAME"] = {
          ["PID:VID"] = "MODEL_NAME",
          ...
      }
  ```

- It is necessary to add commands to start/stop sending data to the port in the configuration file.
  (if such commands are not required, you must set "-" instead of commands)

  CONFIG PATH: [/usr/share/gpoint/lib/config.lua](root/usr/share/gpoint/lib/config.lua)

  ADD DEVICE:

  ```lua
  local MODEM = {
      DELL = {
          START = "AT+GPS=1",
          STOP = "AT+GPS=0"
      },
      MY_DEVICE_WITH_START/STOP_COMMAND = {
          START = "DEVICE_AT_COMMAND_TO_START",
          STOP = "DEVICE_AT_COMMAND_TO_STOP"
      },
      MY_DEVICE_WITHOUT_COMMAND = {
          START = '-',
          STOP = '-'
      }
  ```

- That's it! Now your device works with GPoint!
